# -Vendor-Report
Vendor Report In my recent project, I explored strategies to enhance profitability in wholesale and retail by focusing on efficient inventory and sales management. Businesses often face challenges such as pricing inefficiencies, slow inventory turnover, and overreliance on specific vendors

My analysis was structured around:

1. Identifying underperforming brands for promotion or price adjustment.
2. Highlighting top-performing vendors that drive sales and gross profit.
3. Evaluating the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
4. Measuring inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.
5. Comparing profitability between high- and low-performing vendors.

This work reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in optimizing pricing, vendor relationships, and inventory strategy to maximize profitability.
